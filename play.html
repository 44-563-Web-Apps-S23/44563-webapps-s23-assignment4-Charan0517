                 _An intrenchment in Canada, near Niagara Falls, in the year 1814.
                 Night, shortly before dawn._
        
                 _On the right, the dull glow of a smouldering wood fire ruddies the
                 earthen embankment, the low-stretched outline of which forms, with
                 darkness, the scenic background._
        
                 _Near the centre, left, against the dark, a flag with stars floats
                 from its standard._
        
                 _Beside the fire_, ANDREW, _reclined, gazes at a small frame in his
                 hand; near him is a knapsack, with contents emptied beside it_.
        
                _On the embankment_, JOEL, _with a gun, paces back and forth, a
                blanket thrown about his shoulders_.
        
        
            JOEL. [_With a singing call._] Four o'clock!--All's well!
        
                [_Jumping down from the embankment, he approaches the fire._
        
            ANDREW. By God, Joel, it's bitter.
        
            JOEL. [_Rubbing his hands over the coals._] A mite sharpish.
        
            ANDREW. [_Looks up eagerly._] What?
        
            JOEL. Cuts sharp, for Thanksgivin'.
        
            ANDREW. [_Sinks back, gloomily._] Oh! [_A pause._] I wondered you should
                agree with me. You meant the weather. I meant--[_A pause again._
        
            JOEL. Well, Andy, what'd you mean?
